### What is SAPFLUXNET?

*  SAPFLUXNET is an initiative aiming at compiling a **global database of sap
   flow measurements in plants** led by
   [CREAF and an international team of researchers](http://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat/app/team/).
   The main goal of SAPFLUXNET is to advance in the scientific understanding of
   the **ecological factors driving plant transpiration across the globe**.

*  We invite the sap flow community worldwide to contribute with datasets to
   SAPFLUXNET. Before contributing with your data, please check that they
   fulfill the basic [[Data requirements]].

### SAPFLUXNET objectives

1. To assemble a global database of sub-daily, tree-level sap flow, associated
   plant traits and site metadata.
2. To estimate parameter-based traits related to physiological regulation of
   transpiration at scales from hours to entire growing seasons.
3. To analyse the main ecological drivers of transpiration-related traits and
   annual tree transpiration.
4. To investigate the co-variation of water use traits with other (mostly
   hydraulic) plant functional traits and its role in shaping the drought
   vulnerability of woody species.


### SAPFLUXNET acknowledgements

SAPFLUXNET begins as a 3-year project starting in October 2015 at CREAF and
funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO (Grant NÂº
CGL2014-55883-JIN).
