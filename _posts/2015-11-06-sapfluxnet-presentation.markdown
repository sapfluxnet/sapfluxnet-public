Sapfluxnet: a global database of sap flow measurements
===

* SAPFLUXNET is an initiative which aims at compiling a global database of sap flow measurements in woody plants. 

* The database will allow new exciting analyses at the global scale and it will be first made available to all data contributors and then to the entire scientific community.

* SAPFLUXNET begins as a 3-year project starting in October 2015 at CREAF and funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness MINECO (Grant NÂº CGL2014-55883-JIN).

Data contribution
------------

* In a first stage, we would like to have an idea of the amount of data available globally, and the number of potential contributors to SAPFLUXNET.

* We kindly ask that you **fill the form below** if you have measured **sap flow during at least one year/growing season**, and **let us know if you would be willing to contribute to SAPFLUXNET**.

* The **data collection period is projected to begin in early 2016**. More details on the **data policy will be available then**. If at this stage you are unsure whether to contribute because you would like to know the precise terms of the data policy, please specify this in the form (i.e. 'Yes, conditioned on the data policy terms').
 
* Do not hesitate to contact us (Rafael Poyatos, r. poyatos@creaf.uab.es) for more information
